-- I recently wanted to ask my neighborhood their favorite snacks for a summer sale this year and I wanted to use SQL to collect my data.--

CREATE DATABASE neighborhood

USE neighborhood;
CREATE TABLE neighbors(
home CHAR,
water_ice CHAR,
drink CHAR,
budget FLOAT,
residents INT,
PRIMARY KEY (home))
