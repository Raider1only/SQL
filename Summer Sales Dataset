-- I recently wanted to ask my neighborhood their favorite snacks for a summer sale this year and I wanted to use SQL to collect my data in dataset of my own creation.--

CREATE DATABASE neighborhood

USE neighborhood;
CREATE TABLE neighbors(
home VARCHAR,
water_ice VARCHAR,
drink VARCHAR,
budget FLOAT,
residents INT,
PRIMARY KEY (home))

INSERT INTO neighbors (home, water_ice, drink, budget, residents)
VALUES
('Summers', 'Rainbow', 'Pepsi', 7.25, 3),

('Jones', 'Rainnow', 'Orange', 9.00, 2),
('Lott', 'Mango', 'Mountain Dew', 15.00, 3),
('Kents', 'Lemon', 'Water', 6.50, 2),
('Geyette', 'Lemon', 'Pepsi', 10.00, 4),
('Gonzalez', 'Cherry', 'Sprite', 12.00, 5),
('Ryder', 'Lemon', '7 Up', 5.00, 1);

--Here are some questions and requests from the data.--

--Pull up the data.--
SELECT * FROM neighbors

--How many neighbors want Lemon?--
SELECT * FROM neighbors WHERE water_ice = 'Lemon'

--What is the max pay for the most snacks?--
SELECT MAX(budget) as highest_sale FROM neighbors 

--What is the average sales per neighbor?--
SELECT AVG(budget) AS average_sales FROM neighbors 

--More neighbors want to join the sales but we need to reduce the names for space. Please do so.--
Alter table neighbors
MODIFY COLUMN drink varchar(3);

--Identify the families that ordered Cherry and Lemon flavors.--
select *,
case
when water_ice = 'Lemon' then 'Lemon_family'
when water_ice = 'Cherry' then 'Cherry_family'
else 'Other_Flavor'
end as 'Flavor orders'
from neighborhood.neighbors

--We want to give back $5 back to each customer. Make a new set showing the difference in sales.--
