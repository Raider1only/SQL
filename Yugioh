--Hello I created this database and table based on my love of Yugioh and wanted to show case my sql skills in making queries from it.--

--Here I start with a basic place for the information to be stored in MYSQL--

CREATE DATABASE Hobby;

--Here is where I created the perimeters by creating columns and rows by also giving them their appropriate values--

CREATE TABLE Yugioh(
Character TEXT,
Series_Debut TEXT,
Series_Number INT
);

--After that I decided to put in the information of at least three characters from each show as well as what show each is and what number each appeared as--

INSERT INTO Yugioh (Character, Series_Debut, Series_Number ) VALUES 
('Yugi','Yugioh', 1,),('Jaden','Yugioh GX', 2),('Yusei','Yugioh 5ds', 3),('Yuma','Yugioh Zexal',4),('Yuuya','Yugioh Arc-V',5),('Yusaku','Yugioh Vrains', 6),
('Kaiba','Yugioh',1),('Zane','Yugioh GX',2),('Jack','Yugioh 5ds',3),('Kite','Yugioh Zexal',4),('Declan','Yugioh Arc-V',5),('Revolver','Yugioh Vrains',6),
('Marik','Yugioh',1),('Darkness','Yugioh GX',2),('ZONE','Yugioh 5ds',3),('Don Thousand','Yugioh Zexal',4),('Zarc','Yugioh Arc-V',5),('AI','Yugioh Vrains',6)

--I decided I wanted to add a new column based on my likeability for each character so I made a personal rating into the table.--

ALTER TABLE Yugioh ADD Ratings INT;

--Then I put in the values of each of their ratings.--

UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 10
WHERE Charcter = 'Yugi';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 8
WHERE Charcter = 'Jaden';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 7
WHERE Charcter = 'Yusei';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 4
WHERE Charcter = 'Yuma';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 3
WHERE Charcter = 'Yuuya';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 7
WHERE Charcter = 'Yusaku';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 9
WHERE Charcter = 'Kaiba';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 5
WHERE Charcter = 'Zane';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 8
WHERE Charcter = 'Jack';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 7
WHERE Charcter = 'Kite';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 5
WHERE Charcter = 'Declan';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 8
WHERE Charcter = 'Revolver';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 10
WHERE Charcter = 'Marik';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 2
WHERE Charcter = 'Darkness';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 4
WHERE Charcter = 'ZONE';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 5
WHERE Charcter = 'Don Thousand';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 6
WHERE Charcter = 'Zarc';
UPDATE Yugioh
SET Rating = 6
WHERE Charcter = 'AI';


--Now after all the changes the table now has a list of every character, the series they originated, the order of the appearence, and finally my personal ratings of each character.
Select * FROM Yugioh
