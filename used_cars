--Cars Dataset I downloaded from Kaggle to Excel. After cleaning the data I moved it to MySQL and answered questions with it.--

--What brand of cars can hold the most passengers?--
SELECT Name 
FROM used_cars_data 
WHERE Seats = "10"

--What is the average lifespan of different car brands and models before they are resold or traded in?--
SELECT AVG(Year), AVG(Kilometers_Driven) 
FROM used_cars_data 

--How many cars used Diesel in 2014?--
SELECT COUNT(Fuel_Type) 
FROM used_cars_data 
WHERE Fuel_Type = "Diesel" AND Year = "2014"

--Is there a correlation between the horsepower of a car and its mileage time?--
SELECT Mileage, Power 
FROM used_cars_data
